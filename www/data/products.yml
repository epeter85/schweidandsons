Our cattle are Certified Humane, both raised and handled, and have never been exposed to antibiotics, hormones or steroids, ever.

  offset: offset35px
  cow: cow-5
  description: We call it the Grass Fed Standard for a reason. It’s a new standard in grass fed burgers. Using select genetics as a source for the cattle, we work with American family farms, who feed their cattle an all forage-based diet. Never any grain. They are raised and handled humanely at all times. This process of cattle production is good for the environment, the animals, and you, the one eating the supremely delicious burger. Like many of our cattle, our grass-fed cattle are never given synthetic hormones or sub-therapeutic antibiotics. This blend has higher amounts of Omega-3 essential fatty acids, CLA, beta carotene, and other essential nutrients, while being lower in saturated fats, calories and cholesterol making it healthier than the average beef blend. But most of all, it tastes amazing.
